<h2>How is writing relevant to us as a society?</h2>
<p>The importance of writing goes back for centuries and centuries. Even in the country we live in, writing is important. Why? Because. Think of our laws. Our constitution. The bills that our President, Congressmen, Senators, and Governors pass on a daily basis. How can writing not be important?</p>
<p>And that's just one example. Think of the entertainment industry. How people use writing as an outlet to express themselves. That inner artist is palpable. Humans are emotional creatures. Could you imagine if musicians, authors, singers, songwriters, film makers, and more couldn't write or talk about how they feel?</p>
