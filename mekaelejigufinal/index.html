    <p>Welcome to Write or Wrong! As you can tell by the site's title, the main purpose of this site is anything as it pertains to writing. Business ideas, help on a homework assignment, creative ideas you feel the need to share, the past history and relevance of writing, as well as the facts of it as a medium. I hope this website serves to enlighten everyone of their inner artist.</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Mekael Ejigu. My love affair with writing began at a young age. Growing up in my household, my parents bought me video games and I had access to the Internet and television. Seeing all these different mediums, on top of being exposed to music, allowed me to tap into my inner creator. To compare it to biology, writing is the first building block to education. We are taught to read the written thoughts of others from a young age. We expand on these concepts as we grow older. Even in STEM fields, there is a certain intellectual prowess to the textbooks a physicist or a mathematician in the making use. I created this site as an outlet for writers, who either want to create a work of their own, need ideas, or just want to practice. You're either write...or you're wrong. Enjoy!</p>
