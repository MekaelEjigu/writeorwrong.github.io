<p>Are you ever confused about where to go next? Writer's Block is a common problem for writers. Here are some tips in the video above in the meantime to keep you occupied. We are about to implement a forum for discussion in depth where our writers can exchange ideas for inspiration.</a></p>
<h1>Other Ways of Dealing with Writer's Block</h1>
<a href="https://goinswriter.com/how-to-overcome-writers-block/">How to Overcome Writer's Block</a>
<p>The above link describes the causes and remedies for writer's block.</p>
<ul>
<li>Timing. Timing is everything. Your ideas may need some time to simply ruminate. Wait a bit before writing them down.</li>
<li>Fear. Be it fear of rejection or fear of judgment, not many are ballsy enough to put themselves out there. Don't be afraid - embrace it.</li>
<li>Being a perfectionist. The syntax, the grammar, the delivery - everything has to be on point. Sound familiar? You may be a perfectionist. The blog post gives you a resource  that tells you if your work and content are good enough.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remedies</h2>
<p>Thankfully, there are several remedies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a walk. Sometimes all you need is a simple physical exercise to clear the mind.</li>
<li>Eliminate distractions. Cut that gaming off, turn off social networks, and any music (unless it helps).</li>
<li>Do something to get your blood running. The endorphins running through your body will help. Some rely on running, others do weightlifting.</li>
<li>Brainstorm. Consider some things you haven't tackled yet.</li>
<li>Spend time with a loved one. Hell, maybe they could give you some food for thought!</li>
<li>Change your environment. Studies have shown that libraries and cleaning up cluttered environments such as your room are great for improving focus and concentration. Try it sometime!</li>
